# RobloxShortcutGenerator
## Installation:
Just extract the 'RobloxShortcuts' folder to documents/desktop or wherever you want to keep it. All files are necessary, dont delete, move, or rename anything

## Usage:
Run RobloxShortcuts.exe to open the tool.

Enter the ID of the game into the GameId box.

If the ID is correct, the games name + icon should appear. If the ID is incorrect, the tool will probably crash (I'll fix this later)

To create a desktop shortcut, click 'add desktop shortcut' a shortcut
with the name + icon of the game should appear on the desktop

Finally, you will need to login the account you want to play with. Click the green 'login to account' button and login exactly how you would on the website. Once logged in, click 'Authenticate'.

If successful, you are now good to go! Double click the shortcut on the desktop to run it.

## Things to note:

If you move the RobloxShortcuts folder once shortcuts are generated, they will stop working. You will have to generate new shortcuts or edit the path of the shortcut.

If desktop icons dont update, try opening command prompt and entering 'ie4uinit.exe - show' to update windows icon cache.

To view the source code, you'll need Visual Studio (I wrote this using Community 2019, but should work in other versions). You'll also need to install Magick.NET-Q16AnyCpu and System.Text.Json using Nuget Package Manager.
